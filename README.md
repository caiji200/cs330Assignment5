Project topic: CPU scheduler

programs for a virtual CPU scheduler with some functions to schedule processes: 

1. FCFS (first-come-first-serve): 
It schedules process in the order with which process come in vector first, which will be list as first.then comes second will be listed as second.

2. SJF (shortest job first): 
Which process has the shortest processing time will be listed as first, then is second shortest...

3.Priority:
Which process has the higher proirty will be listed as first (from 1 to n, 1 is the highest).

4.RR(round-robin):
The burst time will increment by time quantum, it will loop until the bursttime almost equal to processing time.

reproduce: use IDE to build solution, then debugging, process with (priority, processing time, burst time, name) has been given).
